<!--more-->

<p>It’s been a while since we last wrote a devblog. We were so focused on getting a release out that we never took the time to write a new blog. Now that Reality Mod has been out for more than a while, it’s time we share some insights on what’s been going on after release.</p>

<h2 id="release-of-v010">Release of v0.1.0</h2>

<p>So what happened after v0.1.0 released? Many contributors spent many hours on Reality Mod after release. Many bugs and quality of life features were fixed. Community servers had to be set up, administrative tools had to be added.</p>

<p>One of the things we unfortunately weren’t able to solve are the crashes many of our players experienced. These crashes were the main reason we postponed the main release before. You might wonder why we didn’t delay again. The last 3 times we delayed, the team fell apart a bit. People would lose motivation or move on to another thing. This time we had strong beliefs we would be able to solve the crashes in a timely manner after release.</p>

<p>After release we were happy to see many people from the community enjoying themselves. Actually more than <strong>50 thousand</strong> of you have tried Reality Mod, which makes us extremely happy. We got feedback, which allowed us to set new goals and move forward. We have lost some good contributors to the team unfortunately. Some of you might already have expected it, but 3ti65 is no-longer part of the team, at least for the time being. This put us in a bad spot as we had to reinvent the entire way of working on Reality Mod. All documentation and processes had to be re-written.</p>

<p>It did however allow us all to take a step back as well and reconsider the way we want to work on this project. It also made us realize that you should never be dependent on one person. We’ve since then split the team up into separate workforces.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Game Dev: Focused on everything related to Reality Mod itself.</li>
  <li>Game Design: Focused on anything design related. Game mode design, UI design, Gameplay mechanics, etc..</li>
  <li>UI: Focused on the UI of Reality Mod and other UI projects we have.</li>
  <li>Tools: Focused on the backend of Reality Mod and other tools like Venice Unleashed Mod Manager and our Discord Bot.</li>
  <li>Mappers: Focused on creating our custom maps and fixing the existing maps.</li>
  <li>Quality Assurance : Focuses on testing the game but also helps the rest of the team with many other tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh and if you feel like helping us out, we are always looking for Developers, Quality Assurance, Marketing, Level-designers. More info on that is in our Discord.</p>

<p>Furthermore we’ve also started to put some focus on documentation. Not only for our own team, but also for the community. You can check it out here: <a href="https://wiki.bf3reality.com">https://wiki.bf3reality.com</a>. We would be lying if we said we have it all figured out, but we can assure you that we’re getting better every day. At the end of this devblog you will find the first hint of that in the updated roadmap for Reality Mod.</p>

<h1 id="update-v020">Update v0.2.0</h1>

<p>That was more than enough of the past, it is time to look at the present and forward into the future! Starting with some of the major features that come with 0.2.0.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-ui">A new UI</h2>

<p>One of the most noticeable changes on Reality Mod is the new UI. Now that we have built a solid foundation for Reality Mod, it was time to update the mod with a new fresh look. The UI-team did a complete overhaul, starting basically from scratch and changing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The loading screen for maps</li>
  <li>The spawn screen</li>
  <li>Map style</li>
  <li>The Esc menu</li>
  <li>The HUD (Compass, chat, weapon selection)</li>
  <li>Message boxes</li>
  <li>All images on the map were replaced with newer/better ones</li>
  <li>New font</li>
</ul>

<p>We also made the UI fit better on widescreens, everything is now within the 16:9 aspect ratio. No more twisting your neck to find out how many mags are left in your inventory! We are really proud of this and we are curious to find out what you think!</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="ESC menu" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image14.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image14.png" alt="ESC menu" /></a><small>ESC menu</small></div>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Loading screen" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image12.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image12.png" alt="Loading screen" /></a><small>Loading screen</small></div>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Squads screen" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image7.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image7.png" alt="Squads screen" /></a><small>Squads screen</small></div>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Alert box" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image1.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image1.png" alt="Alert box" /></a><small>Alert box</small></div>

<h2 id="armored-transport-jeeps">Armored Transport Jeeps</h2>

<p>The most noticeable new feature of course will be the addition of vehicles. This should help teams get around the map in a more efficient way. For the US forces we have the HMMWVs and for the Russian forces there will be Vodniks. With this first iteration of vehicles we have put down a solid foundation to work from in the future. We are excited to see how you guys will be using these assets. We have given both vehicles an additional 3 seats with 6 total. The vehicles will now feel like actual armored vehicles with a health buff. The vehicles have been modified to simulate real military vehicles.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Vodnik and HMMWV" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image6.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image6.png" alt="Vodnik and HMMWV" /></a><small>Vodnik and HMMWV</small></div>

<h2 id="combat-engineer-class">Combat Engineer class</h2>

<p>To counter the vehicles that come with this patch, we have added the Combat Engineer class. We added AT mines, and a repair torch to the mod. The Combat Engineer kit will have a standard issued rifle, frag grenades, C4, repair torch, and AT Mines. The frontend or UI part of this task was done by our UI team. They created a nice wrench icon for the kit and of course a way to mark those damned mines on the map.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Combat Engineer class" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image11.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image11.png" alt="Combat Engineer class" /></a><small>Combat Engineer class</small></div>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="AT mine icon" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image2.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image2.png" alt="AT mine icon" /></a><small>AT mine icon</small></div>

<h2 id="skirmish-game-mode">Skirmish game mode</h2>

<p>Every full server starts with one guy joining the server and wanting to play. Gradually more and more players join the fight. With the current maps in Reality Mod the process of seeding a server was a tough process, long walks and huge areas to cover. With the addition of the Skirmish gamemode we give server administrators more control over those early gaming hours and the experience people have on lower population counts. So what exactly is Skirmish:</p>

<p>In Skirmish the map sizes are greatly reduced to prevent the endless walking we all have that love/hate relationship with. Each map will come with 3 flags to capture and hold. Both teams start out with 250 tickets,the goal is to drain all enemy tickets. FOBs are not in this gamemode but squads can place rally points. Rally points will still last only a minute. To compensate for the lack of FOBs squads will be able to place one every 2 minutes and 30 seconds compared to 5 minutes in AAS. No artillery support is available. With this we aim to provide a tactical, intense experience at lower player counts.</p>

<h2 id="freelook">Freelook</h2>

<p>Although it may seem as a small feature we believe freelook will change the way you will play Reality Mod. Being able to freely look around with your head grants the player a wider field of view which you can access now more easily while still following the same path. The default key for this is L.Alt. It’s not perfect like triple AAA games however it gets the job done.</p>

<div style="position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(41.67% + 44px)"><iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/WillingShoddyImpala" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<h2 id="magazines-and-the-bullet-count">Magazines and the bullet count</h2>

<p>We have implemented our own system solution for magazines as vanilla frostbite does not allow us to do a “realistic” implementation of magazines. A magazine will now keep its “bullet state”. This means when you reload and you still have bullets in the magazine, you won’t just drop the magazine and lose the ammo (as in the current implementation) but rather store it for usage later. The newly added ammo check feature (Hold F with default setting) plays nicely into this.</p>

<p>Now that you don’t waste ammo anymore by reloading with bullets left in the magazine, we felt it was time to make the Rifleman kits more important on the battlefield. What sets apart the rifleman from the rest of the kits? That’s right, the ammo bag. With the removal of the ammobox from the FOB, rifleman will be your only source for more ammo. Make sure you have one in your squad before entering the battlefield!</p>

<h2 id="capture-indicator">Capture indicator</h2>

<p>A lot of players have mentioned that the current capture indicator is a mess as you have to open the squad menu (Caps-Lock) to view the capture status. We have heard you and implemented a new UI element for it. The capture status will now additionally be displayed on the top-center of your screen when you are in a capture zone. Giving you quick access to the information you need without reducing your situational awareness.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Capture indicator" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image15.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image15.png" alt="Capture indicator" /></a><small>Capture indicator</small></div>

<h2 id="medic-radar">Medic radar</h2>

<p>One of the goals for Reality Mod is to increase the value of a player’s life. To aid this we have added the “Medic radar” to the UI. This feature shows any medics in range when you are downed. You can find the information in the bottom right corner. We hope that players will consider not giving up instantly and saving the team a ticket when a medic is in range. The medic radar works both ways, it also displays downed players on the medic’s compass.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Medic radar on the bottom right corner" href="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image9.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-5/image9.png" alt="Medic radar on the bottom right corner" /></a><small>Medic radar on the bottom right corner</small></div>

<h2 id="recoil-adjustments">Recoil adjustments</h2>

<p>We have adjusted the recoil system, adding compensation for the first bullet/bursts and improved the feeling of weapons in full auto encouraging a more diverse usage of firemodes in response to the current single shot meta. This should also make using the bipod on the LMGs more viable. What more can we say? Switch your rifle to full auto and experience it for yourself.</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXYwSDXLF-I" data-videoid="wXYwSDXLF-I" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<h2 id="low-health-visual-environments">Low health visual environments</h2>

<p>We changed the low health visual environment to be a little more forgiving. We even called it the Fucked Up State. It will still limit your vision at a distance, but at closer distances it clears up a bit. This will make it a little easier to get yourself to cover and yell for the medic!</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa_YN82oCLU" data-videoid="pa_YN82oCLU" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<h2 id="low-health-visual-bug-fixed">Low health visual bug fixed</h2>

<p>One of the most annoying bugs in Reality Mod was the low health visuals sticking with you even though you were brought back to full health by a medic. The changes mentioned above
fixed the blurred vision bug after getting treatment from your medic! No more need to get stabbed by a medic to fix this yourself.</p>

<p>We are going with a different approach on the roadmap. The end goal of Reality Mod, a more immersive, tactical, combined arms warfare experience is still the same, but certain aspects of that are dependent on reverse engineering BF3. With the new format, which will be updated as more features become available to us, we are looking to create an honest representation of what we can achieve in the near future. In addition to the updated roadmap we will do our best to provide you with devblogs highlighting the projects of the various teams working on Reality Mod.</p>

<p>For now all that is left for us is to wish you guys all the fun with the update and we hope to see you soon on the Battlefield.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We hope you all have been doing well! The team has made some nice progress, which means we are one step closer to release!</p>

<p>While VoIP is still being worked on we still wanted to share some exciting insights into what’s new with Reality Mod. First off we have Audio Improvements with Joe, followed by A closer look at Vehicles with Janssent and last, but not least, our Dev Spotlight with Joe again!</p>

<p>Let’s get right to it!</p>

<h1 id="audio-improvements">Audio Improvements</h1>

<div class="tag">
        Joe 
      </div>

<p>Hey all, Joe here again! You may remember me from the artillery article in the second Dev Blog. I’ve been working hard (as always) on various tasks since then; mainly, I’ve been working on improving the audio to make the player experience more immersive.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wrong-with-the-vanilla-audio">What is wrong with the vanilla audio?</h2>

<p>In vanilla BF3 the audio does not travel very far. During playtesting we discovered that the vanilla system works well for distances of 50-100m, but outside of that it is impossible to tell where you are getting shot from since the sounds quickly fade outside of that. For us that was problematic, since we substantially increased the range of engagements in Reality Mod to more realistic standards and removed vanilla UI indicators showing the direction you are taking shots from. So in order to really hear what is going on in the battlefield around you, we needed to somewhat revamp the audio system.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>Frostbite’s audio system is rather complex, using a series of output nodes to control effects and determine how a sound should be heard in the world. These output nodes respond to events and other logic nodes (such as random number generators).</p>

<p>Frostbite supports plenty of different output nodes. There is the FlatOutputNode which has a radius that the sound can be heard within and, as the player gets further away from the source, the sound will get quieter until eventually, they are outside of the radius and can no longer hear the sound.</p>

<p>Another node is the ConeOutputNode that has a radius, similar to the FlatOutputNode, but it will also project a sound in a given direction. The player then must be within the radius and within a given angle of the output direction to be able to hear the sound. That is the reason why it is called Cone, since it will project audio into a certain direction in a cone shape.</p>

<p>Here is a video demonstrating the ConeOutputNode functionality (best heard using headphones). Notice how the sound changes as the angle changes. Be aware that this is a Proof of Concept with exaggerated values, where small changes in the angle heavily impact the resulting audio. This does not represent the final values.</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4Pf_8LYJHU" data-videoid="U4Pf_8LYJHU" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<p>So far, I’ve been working on improving the gun sounds so that players can hear them from much further away, for the sake of both immersion and situational awareness. This had been attempted before, but Frostbite’s HDR (High Dynamic Range) audio system proved to be problematic - the problem being that when you make a sound louder, the HDR audio system prioritises that sound above others and will therefore duck other sounds (such as ambient background sounds).</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-4/dev_graph.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-4/dev_graph.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>This prioritizing and ducking of sounds is handled by the “Radius” and “Loudness” values that can be seen in the screenshot above and is the whole point of HDR audio. If used correctly it can lead to an incredibly rich and immersive audio landscape. Unfortunately it would appear that this was not a correct use of the system and ended up sounding very strange, as someone would shoot a few hundred meters away and all other sounds would be made quieter until the gunshot audio clip had finished playing.</p>

<p>I spent hours upon hours digging through the audio files trying to figure out how to mitigate against this, until eventually I found a little thing known as an “attenuation curve”. From my experience in Unity I knew that attenuation curves are used to control the volume and audibility distance of an audio source. This means that we can now control how loud a sound is and how far it travels - which is exactly what we needed. I found this in each of the output nodes - some nodes had different values to others.</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of the default attenuation curve for the M16A3 gunshot sounds where the X value is the distance from the local player, the Y value is the volume of the clip in decibels and the K value is a modifier used to control the slope of the curve.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-4/attenuation_curve.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-4/attenuation_curve.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>For RM, I have increased both the distance at which you can hear the sounds and increased the volume of each of the sounds too.</p>

<p>Below you can see a Proof of Concept for the changed gun sounds</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICJWXuBRNgA" data-videoid="ICJWXuBRNgA" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<p>After that I wrote a system that allowed me to easily edit the attenuation curves for each gun in the game, so we can have different curves for different sounds. Once that was done, I played around with the values and after a while, I got some very nice sounding guns and looking at how the system works, it’s more than likely to mix and match different sounds.</p>

<p>Here is a video of gun sounds in their current state, note how much further they can be heard compared to vanilla sounds:</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7gG1-LycYI" data-videoid="b7gG1-LycYI" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<p>And finally, here are two clips from a recent playtest, showcasing the new gun sounds in action - clips courtesy of Wonder, one of our QA testers (please excuse the subpar quality of the video).</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2YOPiU9iuk" data-videoid="B2YOPiU9iuk" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>
<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0iIHZ1_A_I" data-videoid="P0iIHZ1_A_I" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<p>Of course, these values are a work in progress and will almost definitely be changed before release.</p>

<p>With all that said, at the end of the day, RM is still a game and having realistic values for guns, explosions, etc. just wouldn’t work in this scenario. I do still intend to increase the gunshot distances further though - basically, we want players to know where they’re being shot from using audio, which is impossible using the vanilla values.</p>

<p>Many more improvements are going to be coming to the audio for Reality Mod too. We plan to introduce “bullet cracks” (which is the sonic-boom caused by the bullet breaking the sound barrier) to most guns that will be heard as a bullet whizzes past your head.</p>

<p>Fortunately the marksman rifles in BF3 already have this so it’s just a matter of porting that over to the other guns in the game.</p>

<p>I believe this will be a huge improvement since it’ll show that you are indeed the target of that bulletstorm coming your way and you might want to keep your head down. We also plan to make improvements to the volume and audibility distance of explosions and vehicles. I, personally, have always found it annoying that games seem to forget just how loud helicopters really are!</p>

<p>I’m very excited for players to be able to experience the changes to the audio system!</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and have a good one!

<div class="tag">
        Janssent 
      </div>

<p>What’s up everyone, I’m Janssent. I’m a 22 year old Applied IT student from Belgium. At first I joined the team as a contributor with very little coding experience, mostly modifying the vanilla vehicles to make them more suited for Reality Mod.</p>

<p>While working on vehicles I gained a lot of experience with VeniceEXT, VU’s scripting system. It’s what lets you modify control game behavior, allowing you to create new experiences. I used that experience to research and create Proof of Concept mods for the artillery strike, texture modifications, material grid tweaks and more.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-the-vanilla-vehicles-unsuited-for-reality-mod">Why are the vanilla vehicles unsuited for Reality Mod?</h2>

<p>Like most things in BF3, the vanilla vehicles do not satisfy our needs for Reality Mod. We want them to look and behave like their real world counterparts. In order to achieve that the flight/driving physics and damage model have to be tweaked. For example the vanilla helicopter physics are very responsive, but do not resemble how helicopters move at all. There is no startup time and it is not possible to roll/loop with the helicopter. Some vehicles also need to be able to carry more passengers to adjust for the increased player count and squad sizes.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-go-about-modifying-vehicles">How do you go about modifying vehicles?</h2>

<p>Every vehicle has set attributes which dictate how it behaves in the game.A lot of the tweaks made to the vehicles are simple changes to these attributes. We can modify them relatively easily by assigning new values. This example shows how the minimum collision speed for the heli to take damage was reduced:</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Reduced the minimum collision speed for the heli to take damage" href="/assets/posts/devblog-4/minumum_collision_sp.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-4/minumum_collision_sp.png" alt="Reduced the minimum collision speed for the heli to take damage" /></a><small>Reduced the minimum collision speed for the heli to take damage</small></div>

<p>Another good example would be the changes to the flight model. This is what happens when you try to roll the heli in vanilla:</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44wbqH9lqh4" data-videoid="44wbqH9lqh4" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<p>Trying to roll the heli in vanilla, forces the heli down.</p>

<p>For the Venom flight physics we wanted to find what was keeping helis from looping. The culprit turned out to be vehicleEntityData.motionDamping (MotionDampingData), after setting it to nil this was the result:</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDMJ34BjDAs" data-videoid="nDMJ34BjDAs" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<p>The helicopter can loop and roll after adjusting the flight model.</p>

<p>Things get a bit more complicated when trying to add more components to a vehicle. Components define physical parts (like wheels or rotors), player entries (driver and passenger seats), weapons, cameras etc. One such component is the Browning M2 as you can see in this clip:</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X88S0J4aWLM" data-videoid="X88S0J4aWLM" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<p>DICE devs added a M2 to EOD bot for lols, the component was disabled (componentData.excluded = true), but the data was kept.</p>

<p>In the Frostbite engine vehicles are created from VehicleEntityData instances. This is where a lot of the common vehicle properties are defined. Aside from these common properties, the VehicleEntityData also has an array field of ComponentData types, this is where the individual components of each vehicle are defined. Below you can see the component layout of the venom helicopter both as structured in the game data, and as separate components in-game.</p>

<p>Example of a Venom Component Data: <a href="https://pastebin.com/seiXju7c">https://pastebin.com/seiXju7c</a></p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="Components seen in-game using the Component Visualiser Mod by txt" href="/assets/posts/devblog-4/venom_components.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-4/venom_components.png" alt="Components seen in-game using the Component Visualiser Mod by txt" /></a><small>Components seen in-game using the Component Visualiser Mod by txt</small></div>

<p>In order to add extra components to a vehicle, new component instances have to be created and added to the VehicleEntityData in the same manner as vanilla BF3. For example in Reality Mod, six SoldierEntryComponentData instances were added to the Venom to allow for more passengers. However, you need to ensure the passenger and co-pilot sitting animations are working properly or character models end up clipping through the vehicle model or end up misplaced.</p>

<p>The modularity of these components is what makes modifying vehicles a lot of fun, as it allows for infinite combinations. No one can stop you from adding 6 weapon components to a scout helicopter.</p>

<p>Unlimited POWER!!!</p>

<p>You can even add a passenger to tip of the main rotor for some epic cinematics:</p>

<h2 id="how-are-vehicles-in-reality-mod-different-from-the-ones-in-vanilla">How are vehicles in Reality Mod different from the ones in vanilla?</h2>

<p>Some of the modifications done to all the vehicles in RM include a wider FOV, a smaller entry radius and a longer startup time. The vehicles were also set up so the opposing faction could not enter them.</p>

      </div>

<p>Hi all, I’m Josephus but you can call me Joe. I’m a 23-year-old Software Developer from England. My role in Reality Mod is to implement new features that you guys will hopefully enjoy. Last year I finished university where I studied Software Development for Computer Games. I joined the Reality Mod team back in June of 2020 - I’ve always loved the Battlefield series (especially 3 and 4) and thought it would be a lot of fun to work on a project revolving around that.</p>

<p>I’ve been programming for almost as long as I can remember - I first started around the age of 13, while I was still in school. I remember downloading Unity 2.6 and building some truly awful things that barely worked (so I guess not much has changed really) using the old UnityScript. As well as programming, in my spare time, I also play computer games, the drums, a little bit of guitar and will often nerd out over a good bit of medieval or classical history.</p>

<p>The first feature I worked on for RM was revamping the FOB and Rallypoint systems. I also created the FOB model that we have in place today! I have worked on plenty of features for this project over the last few months but I think my two favourites were the artillery (because who doesn’t love explosions?) and the new audio design.</p>

<h2 id="software-development-for-computer-games-sounds-fun-did-that-degree-help-you-in-designing-features-for-rm">Software development for Computer Games sounds fun. Did that degree help you in designing features for RM?</h2>

<p>Joe: I wouldn’t necessarily say it helped me design features for this project but it certainly helped me land the role and work well with the rest of the team. In the course, we did a lot of teamwork units revolving around different development methodologies such as waterfall, agile and scrum.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-get-the-idea-to-study-something-unconventional">How did you get the idea to study something “unconventional”?</h2>

<p>Joe: I’ve been programming and developing games from a very young age and I always knew that I wanted to get into some kind of software development. I decided to enroll on a course that I knew I’d enjoy but would also leave me with transferable skills to get into other sectors (I’m currently working as a Software Development at a finance company).</p>

<h2 id="which-games-shaped-the-person-you-are-today-which-features-made-them-special-why-are-they-not-your-favorite">Which games shaped the person you are today? Which features made them special? Why are they (not) your favorite?</h2>

<p>Joe: The first game I remember really enjoying was Call of Duty 4 when I got my first Xbox 360 back in 2009. My dad and I used to play it together because I didn’t have Xbox Live at that point. I’d spend hours learning the maps just to get the advantage over him.</p>

<p>After that, I got into the Battlefield franchise with Bad Company 2, quickly followed by 3 and 4 - Battlefield 4, to this day, is the game I’ve got the most playtime in.</p>

<p>On a slightly different genre, I absolutely adore the older Assassin’s Creed games with my favourites being AC2, AC Brotherhood and Black Flag. Thanks to them, I’ve become a massive history nerd!</p>

<h2 id="do-any-of-these-gamesfeatures-influence-in-how-you-approach-designing-rm">Do any of these games/features influence in how you approach designing RM?</h2>

<p>Joe: They do not lol. Could you imagine being 360 noscoped in Reality Mod?</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-love-or-hate-about-working-on-rm">What do you love (or hate!) about working on RM?</h2>

<p>Joe: The team! I can’t stand them! Nah just joking, they’re all great! I think the only frustrating thing about working on this mod is the Frostbite engine and DICE’s inability to do anything consistently.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-think-makes-rm-a-one-of-a-kind-mod">What do you think makes RM a one of a kind mod?</h2>

<p>Joe: Something I’ve always found annoying about tactical games is that the player controls and animations always feel very clunky but thanks to RM being built upon BF3, that isn’t a problem here. Oh yeah, and the destruction.</p>

<h2 id="which-features-would-you-like-to-see-in-rm-in-the-future-maybe-some-features-from-other-games-or-original-designs">Which features would you like to see in RM in the future? Maybe some features from other games? Or original designs?</h2>

<p>Joe: I think tanks would be good to see and maybe air vehicles with weapons - like a minigun on transport heli (add them back Janssent!) or something.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-for-your-time-it-was-very-nice-to-get-to-know-you-a-bit-better">Thank you for your time, it was very nice to get to know you a bit better!</h2>

<!--more-->

<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>It has been a while since our last Devblog but we finally have some updates for you guys!
First and most importantly, we have updated our Release Plans, next we will take a closer look at our Feature List and what you can expect for Reality Mod, an in-depth look on the damage model adjustments written by Lukita and last but not least this edition’s Dev Spotlight with Paul!</p>

<p>I know you are itching to know about release so let’s just get straight to the point.</p>

<h1 id="yet-another-release-delay">Yet another Release delay</h1>

<div class="tag">
        Lukita 
      </div>

<p>Many of you might have suspected this already: we are forced to delay the release once again. For how long? To be honest, we can’t tell exactly. Here’s why:</p>

<p>Feature wise, Reality Mod is complete for its first release. But the most substantial key feature is missing: VoIP.</p>

<p>For the past 3 years and up until today we’ve been using a custom Mumble implementation as our VoIP solution, but it has been causing us more trouble than joy. Picture mumble as a very old, overengineered pile of spaghetti code that’s incredible time consuming for any enhancements whatsoever. In fact, it was causing so much trouble that we decided to stop fixing it and instead work on a better yet easier to work with alternative which can be directly integrated into VU.</p>

<p>After all, teamwork and communication are the center point of Reality Mod and as such shipping with a defective or no VoIP solution at all is out of the question for us. It would be like shipping a car without an engine. That is why we decided against releasing with Mumble.</p>

<p>However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We are working closely together with the Venice Unleashed devs to ensure that it can be finalized as soon as possible. But by the nature of that and the VU code not being open source, we are dependent on the VU devs in this case. That is also why we can’t really give a good estimate on when we will be launching - it could be finished tomorrow or in a month. We were expecting the VU VoIP implementation to be finished way sooner (hence the previous Q1 estimation), unfortunately that was not the case. But you can rest assured, once we are set on a date we will make sure you will know about it first.</p>

<p>In addition to that, we’re also still having issues with the UI rendering / performance, there seems to be an odd bug in the version of the chromium framework, that we’re using to display the UI, which causes the UI to at times have a slow reaction time or render incorrectly. We have however gained enough data to track it down and we’re already trying out some potential fixes together with the VU devs.</p>

<p>If you feel like you can live with those issues and you can’t wait to try Reality Mod already, feel free to apply for Early Access on our <a href="https://discord.gg/sNwbeHC">Discord</a>!</p>

        Paul 
      </div>

<p>Hi, I’m Paul, a 21 years old student located in the Netherlands. Right now I’m studying Computer Science and started graduating very recently. I am the UI Lead Developer.</p>

<p>Roughly 2 years ago I got in contact with 3ti65. The team was looking for a web developer that could help finish the UI. I was supposed to fix some bugs and add a scoreboard. I remember telling 3ti65 it would take me around 3 months to finish. Boy oh boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>When I started I quickly noticed it was a mess and I suggested cleaning it up and moving to a reactive web framework to make our lives easier (especially mine). Ever since I had been working on rewriting the UI and slowly getting Foolhen and others involved in the process. Half a year ago we got two new awesome web developers on board, Mayson and Dylan. Because of the knowledge I had built up during my stay at RM the team decided to make me the UI lead developer.</p>

<p>Last year I ran my internship at a very interesting company. They taught me a lot about project management, testing and continuous integration. Especially the last skill I learned there is what I’m really utilising in Reality Mod. We now have automated builds that we use for each QA and EA test. Since then this project has also taught me other technologies/techniques I’m using at work and school.</p>

<p>Since I started I’ve grown from a simple web developer into a lead developer. At first this was very challenging as I now had to responsibility manage the people working on the UI. Review code, help people where needed, etc. Now it feels like it’s part of my daily routine and I really enjoy doing it.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-your-main-motivation-to-join-the-rm-team">What was your main motivation to join the RM team?</h2>

<p>Paul: I didn’t know anything about Project Reality yet before I joined the RM team. It just seemed like a challenging project to be part of. In the past I was part of a Call of Duty modding community. Unfortunately because I had only experience with making websites I couldn’t do much else apart from work on the forum and website. When 3ti65 told me they already replaced a huge part of the Battlefield 3 UI I was sold.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-computer-science-help-you-with-programming--designing-the-ui">How did Computer Science help you with programming / designing the UI?</h2>

<p>Paul: I learned most programming outside of Computer Science. My study is mostly focussed on embedded hardware. I still love programming, hence why I learned it in my free time. I started programming when I was 14 years old if I remember correctly. A friend of mine introduced me into some simple web technologies and that’s where it all started for me really.</p>

<h2 id="which-challenges-did-you-face-working-on-the-ui-was-it-harder-than-anticipated">Which challenges did you face working on the UI? Was it harder than anticipated?</h2>

<p>Paul: I totally underestimated the UI. When I joined I told the team it would take me 3 months max to fix some of the bugs and add a scoreboard. Now we are still actively doing work on it.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-love-about-working-on-rm">What do you love about working on RM?</h2>

<p>Paul: The thing I love the most about working for RM is the team. Everyone is very passionate about their work and effort they put into RM. This is just something we do in our free time, yet we’re better managed than the company I work at, amazing!</p>

<p>It’s also really nice to see the things you work on, come back in the game. Seeing others use and play what you’ve worked on feels really good. Besides, if players find new bugs it motivates me to fix them for the next playtest.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-think-makes-rm-a-one-of-a-kind-mod-what-is-your-favourite-feature">What do you think makes RM a one of a kind mod? What is your favourite feature?</h2>

<p>Paul: The thing I love the most is the fact that the mod forces you to work closely with your squad members. Coming from games like Call of Duty this is a big eye opener for me and allows me to think in a more strategic way.</p>

<p>Besides the mod itself, I also love our awesome team, consisting of testers, designers, developers, community &amp; marketing people. Everyone is contributing their own speciality into the project. We have a weekly meeting where everyone shares what they did, what they will work on and what their capacity will be for the next couple of days. We also have an awesome Quality Assurance team whose job it is to test newly added features and help us find and reproduce bugs.</p>

<h2 id="which-features-would-you-like-to-see-in-rm-in-the-future">Which features would you like to see in RM in the future?</h2>

<p>Paul: I would really like to see custom maps, it would be so nice if we can make the maps, coming out of Map Editor, work with Reality Mod. Currently we are still having some issues making them work properly. I would also like to see support for custom assets, but for that we’ll have to wait for the Venice Unleashed team.</p>

<h2 id="which-games-do-you-like-to-play-in-your-free-time-which-games-have-you-learned-the-most-from-do-any-of-those-inspire-your-work-on-rm">Which games do you like to play in your free time? Which games have you learned the most from? Do any of those inspire your work on RM?</h2>

<p>Paul: I used to play a lot of Call of Duty, but ever since I started working on RM I noticed I wanted to play more strategic shooters. Until this day I’m actually still searching, but really want to look into Escape from Tarkov. I also used to play games like Runescape &amp; League of Legends, but nowadays I don’t have a lot of free time, and the time I have left usually goes into Reality Mod.</p>

<p>Besides gaming I do spend quite some time mixing house, tech house and techno music. My goal is to throw some parties here and there when COVID clears up, let’s hope it won’t take that long anymore.</p>

<h2 id="that-was-very-interesting-thank-you-for-your-time-and-insights">That was very interesting! Thank you for your time and insights!</h2>

<p>Paul: Any time, thanks for your interest!</p>

<p>My name is Lucas, I am a Lua developer in the Reality Mod team since May/2020, I work as a Data Scientist at my full-time job and I love game programming. I have contributed to the mod with the new medic system, damage, and destruction tweaks. I also developed a mod called <a href="https://github.com/BF3RM/TestRange">TestRange</a> where you can spawn bots in a variety of ways and distances and it displays how much damage they take every time you shoot them.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_8.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_8.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<h2 id="how-do-bullet-damage-and-destruction-work-in-vanilla-bf3">How do bullet damage and destruction work in vanilla BF3?</h2>

<p>In vanilla Battlefield 3, each weapon shoots a projectile and each projectile has a material pair and attributes that define its damage and how it decays over distance. The following image shows an example for the M16A4 using <a href="http://webx.powback.com/#/Weapons/m16a4/M16A4.json">Powback’s WebX</a>.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_9.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_9.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<ul>
  <li>The M16A4 shoots a 5.56x45mm NATO projectile.</li>
  <li>Its base damage starts at 25 and decays linearly to 18.4. The decay starts at 8 meters and ends at 50 meters.</li>
</ul>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_10.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_10.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<ul>
  <li>Its projectile’s material pair has the following attributes:</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="but-what-are-those-material-pair-values-and-how-are-they-used">But what are those material pair values and how are they used?</h2>

<p>Battlefield 3 has the concept of a Material Grid which defines how materials interact with each other: either what happens when one material hits another and also when two physical objects collide.</p>

<p>An image will make it more clear. I will use <a href="https://github.com/J4nssent">Janssent</a>’s spreadsheet (download below) because it has all the information we need in the same place. I usually open it in Google Sheets although some formulas get broken.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwkEu6MmSC2eXcqlIrlnaMIe8Uw7UFiR/view?usp=sharing">VENICE_MATERIALGRID.xlsx</a></p>

<p>When you open it you will see there is a sheet for every map and one called “MaterialNames”. Let’s look at this one first.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_11.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_11.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>In there you will find two columns: A contains the IDs and B has the material names. Let’s decode the M16A4’s projectile’s material pair then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PhysicsPropertyIndex: 77 → BulletDamage</li>
  <li>PhysicsMaterialIndex: 1 → Bullet</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s check how these two materials interact with “Concrete” (ID 8), for example. If you open any of the map sheets you will notice it will have a symmetric matrix where each row/column corresponds to a material. Each cell contains data about the <a href="https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/vext/ref/fb/materialrelationpropertypair/">MaterialRelationPropertyPair</a> regarding the interaction between the materials in the row/column pair.</p>

<p>In Frostbite, a MaterialRelationPropertyPair has two attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physicsMaterialProperties: array of <a href="https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/vext/ref/fb/physicsmaterialrelationpropertydata">PhysicsMaterialRelationPropertyData</a>. Related with FX triggered when two materials collide (decal of bullet impact in the concrete, sound of the bullet when it hits metal, particles, etc.)</li>
  <li>physicsPropertyProperties: array of <a href="https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/vext/ref/fb/physicspropertyrelationpropertydata/">PhysicsPropertyRelationPropertyData</a>. Related with penetration properties, damage, terrain destruction, etc.</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Look at the cell H4 (Bullet x Concrete) in the sheet XP1_002 (Gulf of Oman map) below. Its value shows that when a bullet hits a concrete material it produces a decal, a visual effect, and a sound. Those three form the array of [PhysicsMaterialRelationPropertyData](https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/vext/ref/fb/physicsmaterialrelationpropertydata) (before the</td>
      <td>in the cell value) for this pair of materials.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_12.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_12.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>Check the cell AP48 (BulletDamage x Head) now, it contains <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"*nullMat*|Damage(335D1BCF-FD1D-4BA4-9594-90C2C5425A7F)"</code>. This means its physicsMaterialProperties array is not defined (null) and its physicsPropertyProperties array has a (MaterialRelationDamageData)[https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/vext/ref/fb/materialrelationdamagedata/] data container, with the given GUID. This is the only thing we need for tweaking the damage between materials.</p>

<p>A MaterialRelationDamageData instance has 7 attributes in total, but I will focus on 3 of them related to damage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>damageProtectionMultiplier: how much of the incoming damage will be applied to the material. Ex: M16A4 projectile at 50 meters causes 18.4 damage. If damageProtectionMultiplier = 0.1, then the damaged material would be hit with 1.84 damage.</li>
  <li>damageProtectionThreshold: minimum damage necessary to actually inflict damage on the material. Following the example from above, if the material gets hit with 1.84 damage and damageProtectionThreshold = 2, then the 1.84 damage is ignored. Otherwise, if this threshold is below 1.84, then the damage would be applied to the material.</li>
  <li>damagePenetrationMultiplier: how much of the absorbed damage (after the damageProtectionMultiplier) is retained after penetrating the material.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this explanation applies from a bullet hitting a soldier to an RPG hitting a wall.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_13.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_13.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<h2 id="how-and-why-do-we-use-that-in-reality-mod">How (and why) do we use that in Reality Mod?</h2>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_14.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_14.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>As the mod name says, we’d like to make BF3 feel more realistic and part of it requires to increase the damage dealt to players when they get shot. But it is not all about increasing damage. We felt that the grenade launchers were destroying building walls too easily, with a single shell, so we decided to tune it down a bit using the MaterialGrid.</p>

<p>But that is not only about increasing or decreasing damage. By using the MaterialGrid we made it possible to deal damage to vehicles with standard rifle bullets, which is disabled in vanilla BF3. This way a helicopter can be taken down by getting shot (a lot!).</p>

<p>Basically, we created a class in Lua that let us define a material grid modification that will replace (or be appended to) an existing material grid relation pair. The image below shows our modification for the pair BulletDamage x HelicopterDamage, used to make normal bullets deal damage to our Venom helicopter. Originally, the damageProtectionMultiplier was 0, preventing the chopper from getting damage. We set it to 0.1, meaning that only 10% of the bullet damage would be applied to the helicopter. And when talking about air vehicles they are usually farther so the bullet damage will likely be small, requiring a lot of bullets!</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_15.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-3/pasted_image_0_15.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>We did the same thing for the grenade launcher (GL) and the building walls. The walls use materials called DamageClass_1, DamageClass_2, up to DamageClass_5. The most common material, used for almost every building wall, is the DamageClass_4. The vanilla damageProtectionMultiplier for GL and these walls is 1.5. We decreased it to 0.2, requiring now three shells to fully destroy the wall. This way the buildings feel a bit safer inside.</p>

<p>By using the MaterialGrid it is really easy to tweak the damage but it has a major downside for quick testing values: it requires a server restart to apply the new values. Due to that and for faster iterations, we decided to tweak the bullet damage to soldiers using the callback (Soldier:Damage)[https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/vext/ref/server/hook/soldier_damage/] on the server-side, which requires simply to reload the mod and restart the round, which is much quicker than restarting the server.</p>

<p>But with great power comes great responsibility. You can turn a simple pistol into a devastating weapon (literally):</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>Welcome to our first Devblog in 2021! Today we have a lot of special guests with us. We have one of our programmers, Josephus, with a look at Artillery in Detail, our UI Designer milk with the Evolution of our UI, some progress in Fixing Crashes with Project Lead 3ti65 and the very first Dev Spotlight with one of our Lead Devs, FoolHen!</p>

<p>Over the years, Reality Mod has managed to gather a variety of incredibly talented individuals contributing in various ways, with currently more than 30 contributors, 15 of which are developers.
With the Dev Spotlight at the end of the Dev Blog we wanted to give our members a chance to express themselves beyond their work on Reality Mod and for you to get to know the people behind the screens and for them to get to know you as well, so leave some questions you would like to have answered in the next Dev Spotlight below!</p>

<p>That being said, let’s jump right into it!</p>

<div class="tag">
        Josephus 
      </div>

<p>Hey, I’m Joe (aka Josephus)! I’m from England and I joined the Reality Mod Team as a Programmer around June of 2020. My first task was to rework the FOB and Rallypoint systems; so any issues you find with that, you’ll know I’m to blame</p>

<p>In the <a href="/devblog/2020/12/09/devblog-1.html">previous blog</a>, Alpha showed you a preview of the artillery strike feature for the first time and in this blog, I will be explaining how it was conceptualized, developed and how it works in its current state.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-2/abbf7ff743abdf13be74.gif"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-2/abbf7ff743abdf13be74.gif" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>I think the artillery strike is actually a very important gameplay mechanic as it allows squad leaders to break stalemates. Calling in an artillery strike is easy
Of course, this feature without any limitations would be OP and so, to call in an artillery strike, these conditions must be met: You must be a Squad Leader; it must have been at least 20 minutes since the round started and it must have been at least 20 minutes since the last artillery strike was called in.</p>

<p>The first version of the artillery strike was actually written by Janssent (one of our Devs) as a separate Proof of Concept mod:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/v4O6lJR">https://imgur.com/v4O6lJR</a></p>

<p>Janssent’s original concept behaved very differently to how it does now. Firstly, the strike was not placed on the minimap, but simply by looking at where you want it to impact (although, this logic was never actually meant for RM). Additionally, it also used TV Missiles (Hellfires / AGM-114) for the projectiles but we decided to change it because you could actually see the missile spawn in the air and come down, which was not very immersive to watch.</p>

<p>Instead, we are now using the mortar projectile, modified to use a different, much bigger and dustier explosion. Damage wise, Janssent’s concept proved too weak. A missile would have to land directly on a player to actually kill them.
The current damage model is way more devastating: If you are in the strike radius and not in hard cover, you are going to die. Of course this is all still likely to change for balancing and performance reasons.</p>

<p>After some experimentation, I changed the explosion to the one that occurs when a tank is destroyed. At first, the team really liked it but after a playtest it was decided that the explosion and the lingering dust was too dark and didn’t really make sense for an artillery strike.</p>

<p>Personally, I love the artillery feature because it’s very much in keeping with RM’s realistic design and while also allowing us to show off BF3’s destruction (which no other tactical shooter has)</p>

<p>Anyway, I think that’s enough rambling about things exploding for me!</p>

<p>I hope to see you all on the battlefield soon!</p>

<p>~ Joe</p>

<h2 id="m777-155mm-howitzer-impact">M777 155mm Howitzer impact</h2>

<p>We are going to be using this most recent version from here on out (probably with a few tweaks). The reasoning for this is that artillery doesn’t create some big cinematic fireball like you’d see in a film, instead it’s much dustier.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Marien or milk and I live in the US. I currently work as an Art Director for a small gaming studio that creates City Builders and Management type games. I am a big fan of FPS games in general, especially the Battlefield franchise, so in my spare time I work on RM as a UI designer.</p>

<p>I mainly base my workflow on personal experience and games in general that I have played. If I were to pick a specific game that is used as inspiration I would have to say Battlefield in general, due to it being the foundation of RM.
When I create mockups I usually start with screenshots from RM or the Battlefield games as a temporary background and evolve it from there, that is why you might find some screenshots of other games in older mockups.</p>

<p>The best UI design for me has an easily recognizable and navigable UI in terms of functionality. Also having an aesthetic that fits the theme of the game is a big plus.It’s very easy to be different, but very difficult to be better</p>

<p>The main difficulty during the initial design process was creating something for a Project Reality style mod that didn’t show too much info, yet did show enough. Deciding what was important for a player and what isn’t. Basically moving away from a more casual UI but making sure brand new players aren’t totally lost.</p>

<p>An example I can think of was the debate on whether or not to show too much info on a flag being capped either through UI, using audio cues, or another way of providing this info to the player. Another one was the compass, on the top, on the bottom? Ultimately we wanted to provide players both options due to different preferences even in our own team.</p>

<p>The design philosophy in short: Taking the Project Reality feel and limitations and translating it into a usable interface for the player. Keeping it simple and attractive at the same time. No fluff, but also not too basic.</p>

<p>That’s all for now and I’m looking forward to sharing further Design stories in the future!</p>

<p>Hey folks, my name is Stefan aka 3ti65 and I’m the Co-Founder of BF3: Reality Mod. Powback and I started this project more than 5 years ago and since then I’ve been working mainly as Project Lead and Lead Dev. As such it’s my task to address the biggest issues that we are struggling with, and right now, these are the crashes that are plaguing RM. In the last Dev Blog we went into detail about some of them and I’m proud to say that we are making progress in this regard.</p>

<p>For example, the mass crash issue has been fixed by the developers of VU.
<a href="https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/general/changelog/#17335">https://docs.veniceunleashed.net/general/changelog/#17335</a></p>

<p>It was related to us hitting engine limitations. However, we are not sure what exactly caused this specific issue in the first place, but we have not encountered it since the hotpatch deployed to VU so we assume it must have been mitigated.
If you are interested in further information you can view the GitHub issue here: <a href="https://github.com/EmulatorNexus/VeniceUnleashed/issues/542">https://github.com/EmulatorNexus/VeniceUnleashed/issues/542</a></p>

<p>Another crash, appearing when loading into the server, has been fixed as well. Apparently it was related to entities and solved by adjusting the garbage collection / destroy callbacks of everything we do with entities.</p>

<p>Generally put: We are basically changing the engine in ways that DICE did not anticipate (obviously) and that can have unforeseen side effects. We also have to deal with a lot of inconsistency and hacky DICE code (DICE pls), and sometimes it becomes quite difficult to find a workaround, etc. But the more we work on it, the better we understand how everything works and the better we can address things.</p>

<p>That being said, we are not quite done here yet, there are more crashes that need to be fixed. Stay tuned for further good news.</p>

        FoolHen 
      </div>

<p>Hello everybody, I’m FoolHen. I’m 26 years old, from Spain, currently studying Industrial Engineering. I’ve been working on RealityMod and <strong>MapEditor</strong> since 2017.</p>

<p>Around 8 years ago I started learning programming in my spare time, starting with web and Android development, but also branched out to other technologies that interested me. But I was looking for a goal, a project that was challenging but fun, which could help me improve my skills. I wanted to collaborate with other people, which helps learn quite a bit as well.</p>

<p>Since it came out, Battlefield 3 has been one of my favourite games. I was new to FPS games, and used to play CS:S, so BF3 blew me away. When I found out about the Venice Unleashed project some years later, I finally found what I wanted to do: Modding BF3. Back then VU was closed and barebones, so there weren’t many people in the modding community.</p>

<p>In early 2017 I met Powback and 3ti65, which were looking for programmers to start building RM. The project seemed like an interesting challenge and still was in its infancy. They had created some PoC (Proof of Concept) mods, but the mod itself didn’t exist yet, so it was exciting to start building it from the ground up.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve been working on both the scripting side and the UI, as well as Project Management. I started with modifications of the soldier mechanics (weapons, movements, basic player mechanics, etc), but as time went on the scope of the project grew, so we overhauled and created new systems and mechanics. Over the years I’ve worked on most of the core features we currently have, some more than others. UI, round logic, custom smoke grenades, recoil, are some of the areas I’ve worked more on.</p>

<p>We have grown quite big since our small beginnings, so part of my responsibility is managing the project and people, ensuring that new developers can learn the tools and structure we follow, reviewing code, reviewing feedback and crash reports, etc.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-industrial-engineering-help-you-with-programming-and-designing-reality-mod">How did Industrial Engineering help you with programming and designing Reality Mod?</h2>

<p>FoolHen: I’ve had some programming subjects in university, but most of what I know I learned by myself, with online guides and courses. But I’ve had a lot of math subjects that have helped me greatly. One of those subjects, mechanics, has been a life saver. It wasn’t about gears and springs as it might sound like, but about 3D coordinate systems: matrices, positions, translations, rotations, etc which are the foundation of 3D games. That said, so far, I haven’t had to use integrals or differential equations, thankfully.</p>

<h2 id="which-challenges-do-you-regularly-face-working-on-rm">Which challenges do you regularly face working on RM?</h2>

<p>FoolHen: One of the hardest challenges is managing our resources. We are quite a big team for a modding project, and by its nature we all work on it in our free time. That means that it is hard to predict when each member will have time and when things will get finished, and sometimes unexpected issues will block this process. Sometimes the tools we have available are lacking and we need to build them or request help from VU developers, or sometimes we are challenged by issues caused by us not understanding how the engine works and it takes time to learn and figure it out. This means that estimations are usually not good ones, and we must be careful and intelligent on what to focus on if we want to meet internal goals.
On the development side, the biggest challenge is trying to understand how Frostbite, the BF3 engine, works. A lot of the time it’s a lot of trial and error, to see what works and what doesn’t, and it can be time consuming.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-love-about-working-on-rm">What do you love about working on RM?</h2>

<p>FoolHen: Playing it. Playing something you’ve worked on and seeing other people enjoy it is really satisfactory.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-think-makes-rm-a-one-of-a-kind-mod">What do you think makes RM a one of a kind mod?</h2>

<p>FoolHen: I think one of the best points is that we part from a really solid game that has aged quite well, runs great and looks beautiful. But in my opinion our best asset is the team we have. It’s well structured, separated into different categories, and we follow development strategies used in the software development industry. We have quality assurance, UI designers, developers with experience in different fields, community management, marketing guys, testers etc. All these sectors managed with the same goal, with regular meetings that assure that we are all on the same page.</p>

<h2 id="what-was-your-main-motivation-to-join-the-rm-team">What was your main motivation to join the RM team?</h2>

<p>FoolHen: As I previously said, I wanted to improve my programming skills and work alongside other people, but I also had other motives. Back then I was starting to be interested in game development. I started building some simple 2D arcade games, like asteroids and snake, to learn the basic math and structure behind game engines, implementing basic algorithms like drawing lines on screen.
For a more academic purpose, I also wanted to improve my English, which working with people around the world ensured me.</p>

<h2 id="which-features-would-you-like-to-see-in-rm-in-the-future">Which features would you like to see in RM in the future?</h2>

<p>FoolHen: Improved gameplay mechanics, which are the hardest things to do and nail. For example, I would love to implement leaning, but it might be too ambitious, especially the animations and their syncing. Body dragging with good animations, like in some single player missions, is also something I would like to add in the future.
But the thing I look forward to the most are custom maps. Frostbite allows for big maps with good performance and looks. As of now we are still working on MapEditor, but I’m sure when we finish it we will see some awesome, custom maps.</p>

<h2 id="which-games-do-you-like-to-play-in-your-free-time-which-games-have-you-learned-the-most-from-do-any-of-those-inspire-your-work-on-rm">Which games do you like to play in your free time? Which games have you learned the most from? Do any of those inspire your work on RM?</h2>

<p>FoolHen: Mainly shooters. I started with Counter Strike and Battlefield, but also branched out to more realistic games. DayZ has been one of the games I’ve spent more time on, even with the amount of issues it has. The detail and realism of the mechanics, especially in regards to bullet physics and the in-depth of the weapons and their handling, is something that made me get into more realistic games like PR and Squad. But nowadays I don’t usually play games, as my free time is more sparse and I spend it on RM or on other side projects and hobbies.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-for-your-time-it-was-very-interesting-to-find-out-some-things-about-you">Thank you for your time, it was very interesting to find out some things about you.</h2>

<p>FoolHen: Of course, and I hope I can see you all in game soon!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>Welcome to our very first Devblog! Today we want to talk about the brief history of the project, the roadmap towards release, our biggest issues / top priorities and a little surprise at the end.</p>

<p>You can expect a new Devblog every 3 - 4 weeks, depending on the pace of development with a detailed recap on our progress.
That being said, let’s jump right into it!</p>

<h1 id="brief-history-of-bf3-reality-mod">Brief history of BF3: Reality Mod</h1>

<div class="tag">
        3ti65  
      </div>

<p>More than 5 years ago, 3ti65 and Powback got together with the idea to build a Project Reality style mod on top of the Venice Unleashed (VU) modding platform (<a href="https://veniceunleashed.net/about">https://veniceunleashed.net/about</a>). Since VU was quite rudimentary and not well documented back then, it took about a year of developing different proofs of concept (modifying player movements / weapon stats etc), before the actual development could start. The two of them got joined by FoolHen shortly after and together they started building the actual implementation of the mod.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-1/pasted_image_0.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-1/pasted_image_0.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>The project was initially supposed to go live way back in 2016 / 2017, but after more and more people joined and more modding possibilities opened up, it was decided to increase the scope and take it a couple of steps further, namely a total conversion mod. The UI got a complete rewrite based on dedicated design concepts and more and more features got polished or added. That and the fact that modding the frostbite engine with self made modding tools is a rather complicated thing to do, resulted in way more development time than initially anticipated.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-1/Edit--6.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-1/Edit--6.jpg" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>In the meantime, the team grew at an incredible pace, as more and more people decided to join and contribute to this first ever total conversion mod built on self made modding tools to a closed source engine. As it stands now at the end of 2020, it evolved into a true passion project involving an incredible amount of 35 contributors, 15 of which are developers.</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-1/Edit-.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-1/Edit-.jpg" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>With the thousands of hours that we put into this project, we want to release BF3: Reality Mod in a state which the team can be proud of and which the community can actually play. With this in mind and being so close to reaching our goal, we decided to delay the release just a bit more to Q1 2021.</p>

<p>Next up we will get into what issues we’re still facing and what’s actually keeping us from releasing in our current state.</p>

<h1 id="roadmap-towards-release">Roadmap towards Release</h1>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a data-fslightbox="gallery" data-alt="" href="/assets/posts/devblog-1/SPOILER_RM_announcem.png"><img src="/assets/posts/devblog-1/SPOILER_RM_announcem.png" alt="" /></a><small></small></div>

<p>As you might have seen it in our delay announcement on Discord already - we are still facing game breaking issues in the form of frequent crashes and bugs that often require server and / or client restarts. We believe that releasing RM without addressing these issues would render it unplayable.</p>

<p>With the release being delayed, there is also more time to implement and polish a good amount of other, smaller features (UI, Quality of Life) that otherwise would not have made it into the release version.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at our biggest issues / top priorities.</p>

<h2 id="game-breaking-bugs--crashes">Game breaking bugs / crashes</h2>

<p>The main reason why we decided to delay the December release were the critical bugs we were encountering. There are not many, but they are quite game breaking (literally).</p>

<h3 id="destruction-mass-crash">Destruction Mass Crash</h3>

<p>The destruction mass crash is related to Havok, the physics engine. When some of the destruction gets triggered, Havok causes a crash related to the handling of debris effects and as a result kicks out almost every player from the server.</p>

<p>We could disable destruction, but we feel like destruction is a key part of Reality Mod, so you can see why we want to fix this one as soon as possible. Unfortunately the Havok part of the engine is extremely complicated to deal with so it’s rather time consuming to find the cause, but certainly not impossible.</p>

<h3 id="loading-crash">Loading Crash</h3>

<p>The Loading Crash is another critical one often encountered when loading into a server. It’s the most common crash we currently have. The good thing about it occurring so often is that it allowed us to gather a good amount of crash reports which have led to a potential fix that is going to be tested in this week’s playtest.</p>

<h3 id="tac-rose-crash">Tac Rose Crash</h3>

<p>Last but not least is a crash sometimes occurring when performing a custom action via the Tac Rose.It is used to bandage yourself, create rallies and FOBs and give orders to your Squad as a Squad Leader.</p>

<p>The crash occurring when using the Tac Rose is hard to track down since unlike the two crashes above, it is a “silent crash”. That means it does not create an error dump so investigating what went wrong is significantly more complicated than investigating crashes that do cause an error dump.</p>

<p>All the crashes that happen for no obvious reasons require a cooperation with the developers of Venice Unleashed. This consumes more time, since they’re also very busy working on VU itself, which is still due to release in December.</p>

<p>Four years ago, when we first started this project we had more issues and crashes than we could count, as VU was in its infancy and lacked stability and features. Since the very beginning we have been working closely with the Venice Unleashed devs to provide issue reports and API requests, which has led to a more complete and robust framework. Along the way, we managed to solve each and every issue we encountered so far, some way harder than the ones we currently face. In light of that we’re very optimistic that our current ones can be resolved rather soon.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-vu-voip--ditching-rm-mumble">Implementing VU VoIP / ditching RM Mumble</h2>

<p>We are currently using a custom implementation of Mumble (called RM Mumble) as our VoIP solution since BF3 vanilla doesn’t offer such functionality. If you played Project Reality you should be familiar with Mumble. For us, it proved to be extremely annoying and a constant struggle to work with.</p>

<p>Other than being annoying to enhance it, it’s also causing an incredible amount of issues during development and playtesting, but luckily the VU devs are working on implementing their own, custom built-in VoIP solution which we will gladly adapt for Reality Mod.</p>

<p>This is mostly implemented and will be ready soon. We will have to test and polish it properly but once that is done, it will not require any downloads and it’s easier to deal with in general, so we are looking forward to that.</p>

<h2 id="server-hosting-and-improved-server-administration-functionalities">Server Hosting and improved Server Administration functionalities</h2>

<p>We think that community hosted servers are the backbone of Reality Mod, just as they were for Project Reality. That’s why we want to make it possible for all communities to host and admin their own servers running BF3: Reality Mod.</p>

<p>For that, we are working on providing a holistic framework to support community servers, both in terms of hosting and administration. While being able to take advantage of already existing BF3 server administration tools, we are also enabling admins to manage their servers from within the game. The goal is to make it as convenient as possible for admins to moderate their servers.</p>

<p>However, what these tools encompass will be revealed in another Devblog, once they’re ready to be shown.</p>

<div class="bt-video-container"><a class="youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjZNPm8pXHo" data-videoid="QjZNPm8pXHo" data-width="480" data-height="360">YouTube Video</a></div>

<h1 id="fireworks">Fireworks</h1>

<p>Despite what it may look like, development is not only about fixing bugs and crashes, but also about implementing cool features and improvements to the gameplay. That being said, we want to show you a feature that will have quite the impact (pun intended) to the gameplay. Video and implementation by our Dev Josephus</p>

<p>The effects, duration and damage intensity are still subject to change. The Artillery Strike can be called in by Squad Leaders every 20 minutes. The goal is to be able to flatten enemy defenses (literally), whenever the battlefield becomes a stalemate, or to use it before an attack as a means of suppression and concealment of own movements. More details about this exciting feature including more footage will come in another Devblog.</p>
